- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that the term "bug" in computer programming originated from an actual insect? In 1947, when the Harvard Mark II electromechanical computer encountered a malfunction, technicians found out that a moth had gotten trapped in a relay, causing the issue. They removed the insect, taped it to the logbook, and wrote "First actual case of bug being found," thus coining the term "debugging."
